# data_mid_bootcamp_project_FIFA_MoneyBall

The main objective of this project is to create a linear regression model to predict the OVA (Overall) of a player based
on it's caracteristics. The dataset used for this project can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/code/sudhanvagudi/fifa-21-analytics-eda

### Objectives
  - Create Linear Regression Model to predict the player's OVA
  - Create graphs to find some relevant information about the dataset
  - BONUS: Point the best reinforcements that fit NÃ¡utico's budget to help the team to achieve the top division of the brazilian championship

### Project Steps:
#### Data Cleaning
  - Drop unnecessary columns;
  - Fix null values;
  - Removing Outliers;
  - etc.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Try to find some relevant information about the data
#### Processing Data
  - Transforming and Scalling numerical columns;
  - Encoding categorical columns
#### Linear Regresssion
  - Build the Linear Regression model to predict the OVA and POT
#### Evaluate Accuracy
  - Use metrics like R2, RMSE and MAE;
  - Improve the model
