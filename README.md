# data_mid_bootcamp_project_FIFA_MoneyBall

The main objective of this project is to create a linear regression model to predict the OVA (Overall) of a player based on it's caracteristics, and do some Exploratory Data Analysis to find interesting insights about the data. The dataset used for this project can be found on [Kaggle - FIFA 21 DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sudhanvagudi/fifa-21-analytics-eda)

## Objectives
  - Create Linear Regression Model to predict the player's OVA
  - Create graphs to find some relevant insights about the dataset
  - BONUS: Find the best reinforcements that fit Náutico's budget to help the team to achieve the top division of the brazilian championship

## Project Steps:
### Data Cleaning
  - Drop unnecessary columns;
  - Fix null values;
  - Removing Outliers;
  - etc.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Try to find some relevant insights about the data
### Processing Data
  - Transforming and Scalling numerical columns;
  - Encoding categorical columns
### Regresssion
  - Build the Linear Regression model to predict the OVA;
  - Use other machine learning models to compare wich one has a higher accuracy
### Evaluate Accuracy
  - Use metrics R2, RMSE and MAE;
  - Improve the model
### Bonus
  - Find the best players for Náutico
